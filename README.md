## Description

This is a weekly blog that will be updated every week with new programming content. This includes but is not limited to: new projects, new technologies, and new ideas for other potential projects. This will be used as means to keep up with my progress as a developer and to keep track of my ideas. 

#### Technologies Used
- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Sanity v3 (Headless CMS)
- Vercel (Hosting)
- Next.js 13 (Static Site Generation)

I built a fully responsive website using React.js and Tailwind CSS. I used Sanity as a headless CMS to store all of my blog posts and learnt how to use the GROQ query language to fetch the blog post content that had been made available via Sanity's public API. I also customised the initial sanity studio and used Authentication to allow access to only a certain number of members. I used Next.js 13 to statically generate the website and to make use of the new Next.js App folder structure. I also used TypeScript to type check my code and to make sure that I was using the correct data types. Lastly, the site is hosted on Vercel - the creators of Next.js.
